function [Influence, FlowMap] = MULTIFLOW3(DEMunprocessed, DEMboundary, m)

% [Influence, FlowMap] = MULTIFLOW(DEMprefill, p)
%
% MULTIFLOW creates and returns an Influence map for a DEM. Influence
% is dispersed across the DEM from a single vent location according to 
% the multi-slope flow algorithm. TopoToolbox is used to fill holes in the
% DEM and to disperse teh flow. The flow size is limited by an emperical
% function of the form : log10(Influence) > a*L^b - c where L (km) is the 
% distance from the vent location.

% Wolfgang Schwanghart and can be downloaded from

% version 2.2, which was the most recent release as of 2-1-19. Additional 
% information can be found in "Schwanghart, W., Scherler, D. (2014):

% Inputs -------------------
%    DEMprefill: MxN rectangular array of elevation ("holes" or topographic
%         lows do not need to be filled) 
%    p is a parameter file, which includes 
%         p.a: coefficient from threshold function 
%         p.b: exponent from threshold function 
%         p.c: intercept from threshold function 
%         p.VentLocations: [x y] pixel locations 
%         p.dx: (grid resolution)
% Outputs ------------------
%     Influence: MxN rectangular array of Influence. 
%     FlowMap: MxN rectangular array of map showing where flow is predicted
%         to occur for the parameters p.a, p.b, and p.c.

% function if problems occur when calling it.
